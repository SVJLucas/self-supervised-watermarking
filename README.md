# The Oxford 102 Flowers Dataset: A Brief Overview

The Oxford 102 Flowers dataset is a popular image classification dataset that contains 102 flower categories, each with 40-258 images. The images have large scale, pose, and light variations, making it a challenging dataset for image classification algorithms.

We will conduct the experiment using 10 randomly selected images from the Oxford 102 dataset. Our goal is to explore the potential of self-supervised models in zero-watermarking and we're going to use this dataset for it.
